# Simple Coder Published Repo

This repo was created from VS Code.

1) I opened VS Code (it already has git and node and npm installed)
2) I created a new folder named `simpleCodeRepo`
3) I added this README.md file to the folder
4) I selected the `Source Control` feature of Code
5) I chose the Publish to GitHub option from the panel
6) I entered the name of the repo in the field at the top/center of Code, `simpleCodePublishedRepo`
7) I selected the README.md file listed under the empty text box
8) VS Code created the repo on GitHub and pushed the README.md file there
9) A snackbar appeared in the bottom/right corner of VS Code
10) I selected `Open the repo on GitHub` option

And that's all there was to it.
